# Assignment 04: City Guide

For this assignment, you will be creating a simple website to act as a guide to your favorite city. Your website should highlight 4-5 of your favorite places in your favorite city. These can include restaurants, parks, museums, activities, or other features you enjoy about the city.

Your content should be well organized and include many of the HTML elements we have learned so far, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and emphasized text.

Do not worry about the style and appearance of your site as much- focus on content structure, and writing good effective content.
