                        Hi! Welcome to my website about the best places to visit in
                        Pittsburgh. It's great to have you here! I’m a lifelong Pittsburgh
                        resident, and am fiercely in love with the city.

                      I’ve spent countless hours exploring the city, and this is a my

                      while I’m home, and try to do as often as possible. Enjoy!

                    The Strip District is one of the culinary capitals of Pittsburgh,
                    with a mix of cuisine largely inspired from the city’s strong
                    Polish and Italian roots.

                <p id="strip_p3">
                  The strip district would be the place to start your Pittsburgh
                  visit off right with a pancake from Pamela’s pancakes, or maybe
                  you’re the type that skips breakfast and goes right for the
                  throat–I don’t judge. If that sounds more your speed, you could go
                  a few blocks down from Pamela’s to Primanti Bros Sandwiches, where
                  you can get a truly one-of-a-kind sandwich piled high with fries
                  and coleslaw.

                    Mount Washington is one of the stops on this list that makes
                    Pittsburgh truly unlike any other city.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The city center itself is built at the intersection of 3 rivers,
                    referred to locals as “the point”, and right across one of those
                    rivers [the Monongahela River, if you were wondering] is a
                    quarter-mile tall riverbank, carved by millennia of the 3 rivers
                    flowing. At the top of this pseudo-riverbank, pseudo-mountain is
                    Mount Washington.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are a variety of things to do at Mount Washington,
                  including riding an incline up the bank (hours included below
                  image), in addition to a multitude of different restaurants
                  and ice cream shops, but the main attraction is unequivocally
                  the view yielded from one of the several viewing
                  decks. I didn’t really fall in love with Pittsburgh until the
                  first time I went to the top of Mount Washington in the late
                  afternoon with a friend, set up a hammock, and watched the sunset
                  over the city as golden hour slipped into dusk, which slipped
                  into evening.

                    Think of Lawrenceville like a younger Strip District–this is
                    a really interesting area, another culinary hub of the city.
                    It’s in close proximity to young startups and Silicon Valley
                    giants alike, making it an exciting and high-energy part of
                    Pittsburgh.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lawrenceville is an interesting, burgeoning community just to
                  the north of the Downtown Pittsburgh area. It’s where you’d
                  go for the best Banh Mi (a Vietnamese Sandwich), Poke
                  (deconstructed sushi bowls), Boba Tea (I think most people
                  know what this is) and much, much more!

                    PNC Park, unlike the team it houses, the Pittsburgh Pirates,
                    is actually one of the city’s claims to fame.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Widely regarded as one of the better stadiums in baseball,
                    PNC Park opens up to a stunning view of the Pittsburgh
                    Downtown cluster of buildings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I put this on a list for an out-of-towner because despite
                    the fact that the Pirates most likely won’t be the team
                    you’ll be rooting for, nothing will console you like
                    watching them get brutally defeated against pretty much any
                    team they play, all while enjoying a breathtaking view!

                    Randyland might be my favorite place to recommend to
                    out-of-towners. Although words can’t really describe this
                    place, my assignment is to describe it, so I’m going to do
                    my best.

                <p>
                    In 1995 Randy Gilson bought a building for $10,000 on a
                    credit card in the then-impoverished North Side of
                    Pittsburgh. His mission was simple–to bring people together
                    with the city’s largest piece of public art, but he had a
                    major obstacle–he didn’t have any money.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His solution was to repurpose garbage that he found in his
                    community as parts of his ‘exhibit’, the building he owned
                    and lived in.
                </p>

                    Some quick facts about Randyland:

                    <li> Randy still lives in the studio on the first floor of

                </ol>
                <p>
                    I went here for the first time last summer, and absolutely
                    loved it. It’s a colorful amalgamation of garbage repurposed
                    by Randy’s imagination that brings joy to everybody who
                    visits it.
