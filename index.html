                Hi! Welcome to my website about the best places to visit in
                Pittsburgh. It's great to have you here! I’m a lifelong Pittsburgh
                resident, and am fiercely in love with the city.
            </p>
            <p>
                While many people have heard of Pittsburgh, not many have been,
                and I think that’s a shame. While it’s not the largest city, it’s
                a charming mix of small-town and big city, the perfect pit stop on
                a road trip as you move from midwest into northeast or vice versa.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’ve spent countless hours exploring the city, and this is a my
              must-hit list: a non-comprehensive list of things that love to do
              while I’m home, and try to do as often as possible. Enjoy!
            </p>

            <h2> The Strip District </h2>
        </div>

        <div id="strip_district_body" class="destination">
            <p id="strip_p1">
                No matter the time of week or year, the strip district is a
                must-hit during your visit to Pittsburgh.
            </p>
            <p id="strip_p2">
                The Strip District is one of the culinary capitals of Pittsburgh,
                with a mix of cuisine largely inspired from the city’s strong
                Polish and Italian roots.
            </p>
            <p id="strip_p3">
              The strip district would be the place to start your Pittsburgh
              visit off right with a pancake from Pamela’s pancakes, or maybe
              you’re the type that skips breakfast and goes right for the
              throat–I don’t judge. If that sounds more your speed, you could go
              a few blocks down from Pamela’s to Primanti Bros Sandwiches, where
              you can get a truly one-of-a-kind sandwich piled high with fries
              and coleslaw.

            <h2> Mount Washington </h2>

        <div id="mt_washington_body" class="destination">
            <p>
                Mount Washington is one of the stops on this list that makes
                Pittsburgh truly unlike any other city.
            </p>
            <p>
                The city center itself is built at the intersection of 3 rivers,
                referred to locals as “the point”, and right across one of those
                rivers [the Monongahela River, if you were wondering] is a
                quarter-mile tall riverbank, carved by millennia of the 3 rivers
                flowing. At the top of this pseudo-riverbank, pseudo-mountain is
                Mount Washington.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are a variety of things to do at Mount Washington,
              including riding an incline up the bank, and a multitude of
              different restaurants and ice cream shops, but the main attraction
              is unequivocally the view yielded from one of the several viewing
              decks. I didn’t really fall in love with Pittsburgh until the
              first time I went to the top of Mount Washington in the late
              afternoon with a friend, set up a hammock, and watched the sunset
              over the city as golden hour slipped into dusk, which slipped into
              evening.
